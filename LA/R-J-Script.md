<center><b><i>Enter Benvolio and Mercutio</i></b></center>



**Mercutio**\
    Where the devil should this Romeo be? Did he come home last night?

**Benvolio**\
    Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man.

**Mercutio**\
    It must be Rosaline, that pale hard-hearted wrench will turn him mad!

**Benvolio**\
    Tybald, Old Capulets nephew sent a letter to Romeo's Father's house.
    
**Mercutio**\
    I have a feeling its a challenge.

**Benvolio**\
    Maybe yes, but Romeo wil anwser.

**Mercutio**\
    Anyman with basic education can read and will respond to a letter.

**Benvolio**\
    Yes, but Romeo will anwser directly to the write, wether or not he accepts.

**Mercutio**\
    Poor, poor Romeo. Struck with Cupid's arrow and stabed by love. His mind infested with \<what>?

**Benvolio**\
    Whats Tybalt's story anyways?

**Mercutio**\
    He stronger than a horse. Does everything as it should be like singing at a recital, paying attention to timing, distance, and proportions. He is a gentalmen from the best of the best of fencing schools, can turn any argument into a fight of wits, or, a fight of swords.

**Benvolio**\
    He knows what?

**Mecutio**\
    All these foreigners, with there new, crazy sounding expressions and phrases. I hate their strange accents and manners, these fashionmongers, these guys who
    say "pardon me," these guys who care so much about
    manners that they can't kick back on a bench without
    whining? "Oh, my aching bones!"

    Ay, a thousand. —Peter

    Before and apace.
