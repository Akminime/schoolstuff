**Mercutio**  
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Did he come home last night?

**Benvolio**  
Not to his father’s. I spoke with his man.

**Mercutio**  
It must be Rosaline, that pale hard-hearted wench will turn him mad!

**Benvolio**  
Tybalt, Old Capulet's nephew sent a letter to Romeo's Father's house.

**Mercutio**  
I have a feeling it's a challenge.

**Benvolio**  
Maybe yes, but Romeo will answer.

**Mercutio**  
Any man with basic education can read and will respond to a letter.

**Benvolio**  
Yes, but Romeo will answer directly to the write, whether or not he accepts.

**Mercutio**  
Poor, poor Romeo. Struck with Cupid's arrow and stabbed by love. His mind infested with what?

**Benvolio**  
What's Tybalt's story anyways?

**Mercutio**  
He's stronger than a horse. Does everything as it should be like singing at a recital, paying attention to timing, distance, and proportions. He is a gentleman from the best of the best of fencing schools, can turn any argument into a fight of wits, or, a fight of swords.

**Benvolio**  
He knows what?

**Mercutio**  
All these foreigners, with their new, crazy sounding expressions and phrases. I hate their strange accents and manners, these fashionmongers, these guys who say "pardon me," these guys who care so much about manners that they can't kick back on a bench without whining? "Oh, my aching bones!"

**Benvolio**  
Romeo, Romeo! Here comes Romeo!

**Mercutio**  
Without his girl, like a dried herring. His flesh, how pale he has become. Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench—marry, she had a better love to berhyme her — Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so — but not to the purpose.

**Romeo**  
Good morning to you both, What counterfeit did I give you?

**Mercutio**  
You disappeared, sir, can you not understand?

**Romeo**  
Sorry Mercutio, my business was great and in such case, I forgot my manners.

**Mercutio**  
That's basically saying a situation like yours forces a man to bow and pray!

**Romeo**  
Meaning with all due respect.

**Mercutio**  
Spot on mate.

**Mercutio**  
Ah, here come the servants of the Capulet's. What news, what letters have you there?

**Nurse**  
Good morrning, gentlemen.
<div style="text-align: right; color: #FF0056"><b><i>[To Romeo]</i></b></div>
Pray you, sir, a word. And as I told you, my young lady wants me to find you. What she bid me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me say: if you lead her into a fool’s paradise, as they say, it would be an extremely indecent behavior, as they say. For she is so young, it would be an ill thing and a very weak deal.


**Mercutio**  
What does a Capulet have for Romeo

**Nurse**
If you say anything against me, I’ll take you down. And if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. And you must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure.

**Romeo**  
Let her speak Mercutio.

**Nurse**
Juliet requests that you meet her at Friar Laurence’s cell this afternoon past sunset.

**Romeo**
Very well, I will be ther. Take this for your troubles.

**Nurse**
I musnt except this! If I am seen with Monteque money..
<div style="text-align: right; color: #FF0056"><b><i>[Gets Cut Off]</i></b></div>

**Romeo**
Please Nurse, take this for your troubles in bringing me this message.

**Nurse**
Very well, so long Romeo. Peter!

**Peter**  
Anon.

**Nurse**  
Before and apace.

**Peter**  
Anon.
